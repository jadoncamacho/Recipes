            <li>1 Egg yolk</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp powdered sugar</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp cold water</li>
            <li>1/2 Tsp salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Egg Custard:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Tbsp hot water</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 Egg</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup milk</li>
            <li>1 Tsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add all dough ingredients into large mixing bowl. Mix and kneed until a shaggy dough is formed.</li>
            <em>* The dough is done if you can form a ball and no chunks of butter are left</em>
            <li>
                Take dough out of mixing bowl and fully cover it in plastic wrap. 
                Form dough into a rectangular shape (no need to be perfect) and refrigerate for 15-20 minutes.
            </li>
            <em>* This is a good time to preheat the oven to 425°F</em>
            <li>
                Cover your workspace in flour (can sprinkle flour as needed if dough is too sticky). 
                Roll the dough out into a large sheet (about 1/4 inch thick).
            </li>
            <li>
                Carefully cut out tart shells with circular cookie cutter (or any alternatives, cups work great!). Should yield about 8-12 tart shells depending on the size.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place tart shells in muffin tin or fluted tart tins (greasing the tins can help pull the tarts out after baking but is not necessary). 
                Carefully mold the dough around the edges to form a tart shape.
            </li>
            <em>* Be sure to leave enough room for the custard filling!</em>
            <li>Start the egg custard by heating the water and sugar in a large mixing bowl until completely dissolved</li>
            <li>Add the rest of the egg custard ingredients into the bowl and mix until homogeneous.</li>
            <li>Run the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer to rid any bubbles and ensure a smooth texture</li>
            <li>Fill your tart cups with custard until about 75% full. Poke holes into the bottom of the tarts using a fork (to allow steam to escape). </li>
            <li>Place tarts into the oven at 425°F and bake for 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Let cool for 10 minutes and serve!</li>
